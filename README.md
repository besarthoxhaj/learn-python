## Learn python my way

In order to understand a programming language I need to know:

- how to `print` stuff
- reserved words
- how to run code in one file
- how to import/require other files aka [module system](https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/modules.html)
- scopes
- how to create a simple server
- [coding style](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

All of it can be found at [https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/](https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/)

### print
In Python 2.x `print` is actually a special statement and not a function.
